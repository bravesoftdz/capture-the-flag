This is a capture the flag game, written back in the day.

This was done in Delphi, and I've lost the means to compile this,
but the two exes will work (in Windows).

This is a two player multiplayer game, with a chat interface.
The two executables are Capture_The_Flag_Server.exe and
Capture_The_Flag_Client.exe respectively.

The player running the server executable will have to give the client
player their IP through some other means.

Each player has limited vision, and several AI ally ninjas, that follow
the opposing player.  The goal of the game is to grab the opponent's flag
and returning to your own flag.

There are items scattered around, and a variety of maps.
